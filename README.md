I'll simplify soon for a easiest way to test... but for now here is how you can test by this way:
Download any manga and add on manga folder, get the default name of image, they all need be the same only diff by page number: 1.filename.jpg, 2.filename.jps, etc.
Then on main.js, edit line 7 with the total pages and 9 with the correct filename, open window.html on navegator and test it!
